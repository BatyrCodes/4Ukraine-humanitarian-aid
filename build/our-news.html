            Not quite where it all started but our first trip under the 4Ukraine
            banner. Delivering a much needed pick-up truck filled with a variety
            of critical aid. We were on the early Eurotunnel on Saturday
            morning, arrived in Krakow late in the evening, delivered the aid on
            Sunday morning and then flew back arriving home again on Sunday
            afternoon. A tough couple of days driving but hugely rewarding. The
            first time we met Andriy and his family in Lancut, Poland - the
            start of an important partnership for the 4Ukraine team. At the time
            we had no idea that this was the start of our friendship and a long
            collaboration.
